# TermShare Player

This repo is intended to provide an alternative asciinema player. The original [player](<(https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player)>) is writtern in `Clojure`. I think it's hard for frontend people to contribute that directly. This project is intended to make it easier for people to contribute by using `Typescript`.

## Instructions

```shell
$ cd <repo> && npm install
$ npm run dev
$ npm run test
$ npm run build
```

## Goals

1. Support orginal asciinema [v2](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md) format and features
2. Support Vue/React/Angular
3. Support Audio
4. May Support Record Editing
